My name is Shelby Smith. I am a developer from Salt Lake City. I have a husband named Eric and two short legged dogs. The older but smaller of the two is named Clementine. She is about 4 and she is a Corgi. The younger, bigger dog is named Beatrice. She is a bassethound and is about 2. I got my degree in Computer Applications in 2017 and tried my hand at a few different roles within my previous company. I loved learning new technologies so much that I struggled to sit still within that company. I tried an assortment of positions until voluntarily leaving due to feeling siloed into a role that wasn't the right fit for me. 
I am currently looking for a position that would let me practice my skills while giving me opportunities to develop new skills.

	<!-- Start of Page Content-->
	<p id="paragraph1"> I was born premature on April 9th 1992 to a loving father, Shawn Whittaker, and his wife Mary Whittaker.
		As a child I was very shy and didn't say much. I found that being an animal suited my quiet nature better
		than being human so I found an animal that I thought suited me best. For the first part of my life I was a cat.</p>
	<p id="paragraph2"> I would imagine being a cat and I would ask people for pets and meow or hiss at them continuously. This lasted 
		for a few years until we got our first dog, Molly. She was a brown mutt with a white patch of fur on her chest. 
		She also had the smallest amount of white on the tip of her tail. It couldn't have been more than 4 hairs. </p>
	<p id="paragraph3">
		At this point I was no longer a cat but a dog. Since then I have always been a dog person. I bribe my parents 
		to steal their dog at night and I laugh maniacly when they give me puppy eyes because I won't let them sleep 
		where they want to sleep. I can't imagine a world without dogs and I don't plan to. </p>

				<h3>The middle of an Autobiography</h3>

</header>
	<p id="paragraph1">  After I graduated high school I decided to go on a trip to Europe. I had no idea where I
		 would go in Europe so I found a map and I put my finger down. The place I landed was Germany. In 2011, after a large 
		 amount of planning and a very minimal amount of underage drinking I flew to Germany all by myself. While I was there
		 I tried as many beers that I could. This was the beginning of a love for beer.</p>
	<p id="paragraph2"> Around 2014 I met a man who liked to drink beer even more than I did. He was just getting into
						brewing beer and this was something I had been considering for a while. My dad used to brew beer
						and people loved it when he did. I couldn't think of a better hobby for me because it was creative
						and the outcome was awesome. I basically demanded that my friend would let me go over to his house and
						we would brew beer together. Now I brew beer in my parents back yard on a regular basis. </p>

				<h3>The End of an Autobiography</h3>
	</hgroup>
</header>
	<p id="paragraph1"> I am a jack of manny traits. I have dabbled in various art forms. I am a terrible musician, a living Piccaso of painters, a terrible speller,
				and I couldn't even get me to wear my own jewelry. Due to the various hobbies that I spend my time working towards the only one that I feel will ever
				impact my life would be computers. I have loved computers ever since I was able to open up paint and draw endless circles until the screen was completely blue.</p>
	<p id="paragraph2"> When I was a prepubescent girl I would spend endless hours instant messaging my life long friend, Aubrey, about boys, music, soda pop, anything that young girls would be into. 
					I began developing my skills in photoshop before I could get my hands onto photoshop. I would crop clip art into other images and with the free time that a 14 year old had, I would spend my days 
					taking pictures of my self in various positions to try and make the image look real. At the time they never did.</p>
	<p id="paragraph3"> I have always loved video games and would spend hours dedicating myself to simulations and puzzle games. As a child I was not aware of the newest equipment but I have 
					learned to keeep those that are aware close so that when they hear something I am the 2nd persont to know. After my friend built me my first gaming tower I have taken an interest
					in learning how to code. What more creative and awesome power than to be able to type words on a screen and allow them to appear in a totally different format in a browser? Nothing will stop me now.</p>

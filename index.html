      <br><br><h1>The Birth and Anatomy of This Site</h1>
      Years ago, I began using <b style="color:yellow">Hostgator</b> to get a familiarity with front end development. 
      I didnt get a lot done because I also started working for a company called LiveView Technologies. I recently left LVT 
      and due to switching hats a lot, I needed a confidence boost in my abilities as a developer so I decided to repurpose my
       old website and make it into something I can be proud of. I hope that this page will give you the information you need 
      to feel confident that I am the right person for the job and would be a pleasant member of the team.
      <br>   I started using her hostgator account to build some static components. I am creative but I am not a website designer so I 
      was more interested in the back end of things than the front end. my skills are mostly with the back end of things and I had peer 
      programmed for a solid amount of my career, so I had never personally did some of the tasks and wanted to be confident in my abilities. 
      As I played with my domain, thinking of what to build, I decided I wanted to better practice my skills with git, so I decided 
      to make a git repo on github using my old <b style="color:yellow">GitHub</b> account.  
      <br> Before finishing setting up my repo, I knew I wanted it to be <b style="color:yellow">CI/CD</b> so I looked up how to implement automatic
      deployments on github and have them sent directly to the cpanel location on her hostgator account. I connected it to hostgator and 
      BOOM, like a strike of lightning, I was agile.  
      <br> I continued my work on my website using only <b style="color:yellow">Javascript, HTML, and CSS</b> until I began 
      getting bored with my access to data. I didn't want to write out a bunch of json files for the things I was implementing so 
      I decided I wanted to add some <b style="color:yellow">Python</b> into the mix. I spent a couple days trying to find a way 
      to use my hostgator account with Python but was struggling to find the features required to use that capability. I reached out 
      to Hostgator and they told me the same thing the websites were saying. I felt certain that I needed to be on a larger plan 
      but didn't want to pay for it. I couldn't ask my husband to spend more money on something so trivial. 
      <br> I pulled out some <b style="color:yellow">Raspberry Pis</b> and began setting up a server for my website. I spent a 
      little bit of time learning <b style="color:yellow">flask</b> so I could put an <b style="color:yellow">API</b> on it the 
      moment I was ready. OnceIe had my api running on my local machine, I began really thinking about what I was creating. 
      I didn't like it. It was hardware and software that I didn't have time to maintain. It made me feel icky and vulnerable. 
      I missed my <b style="color:yellow">AWS</b> environments that were already secure with the appropriate accesses. 
      <br> Feeling Defeated, I reached out to an old coworker. He was kind enough to help me despite having no obligations to me. 
      He told me he didn't know anything about using hostgator for python and to look into <b style="color:yellow">fly.io</b>. 
      This was validating for me because I knew I was spinning my wheels on hostgator. 
      <br> I opened up a tutorial for fly.io and ran through it like butter. I knew I could get something working on this new service. 
      All it took was a bit of <b style="color:yellow">docker</b>. After some tweaking of the tutorial app and refreshing my docker skills, 
      I came out with a fully functioning API. Some Data Entry and finagling of the layout later, I had the Recipe Page.
